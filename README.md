# AIGF-Proj

This repository was created for the purpose of providing a sample of AI training, and API integration into a personal project. OpenAI API was used in this project as well as Sinch (text messaging handling). The purpose of this project was to provide users with a "virtual AI companion" in which chatgpt responses would be sent directly to a users cellphone messenger.
