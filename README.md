# AIGF-Proj

This repository was created to provide a sample of AI training, and API integration into a personal project. OpenAI API was used in this project as well as Sinch (text messaging handling). The purpose of this project was to provide users with a "virtual AI companion" in which chatgpt responses would be sent directly to a user's cellphone messenger.
